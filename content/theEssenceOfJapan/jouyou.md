This philosophy is deeply embedded in Japanese education, business, and personal development practices.

It became particularly influential during the Edo period (1603-1868), when various arts and crafts developed sophisticated systems for continuous improvement. This philosophy has since permeated various aspects of Japanese culture, from martial arts to modern business practices.
