## 6. Balancing Miyabi with Other Aesthetics

- **Contrast to Wabi-Sabi**  
  - While wabi-sabi embraces imperfection and rustic simplicity, miyabi values flawless surface and cultivated formality.

  - Generous use of “negative space” (ma) in screen paintings or room layouts amplifies miyabi’s sense of poised restraint.

3. **Refined Language**  
   - Add poetic touches to writing—mention the time of day or a seasonal reference when sending notes or messages.  
4. **Mindful Presentation**  
   - Arrange meals, workspaces, or décor with harmonious color schemes and precise alignment.
